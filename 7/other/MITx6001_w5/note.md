# Measuring complexity

- Goals in designing programs
    - (1) It returns the correct answer on all legal input
    - (2) It performs the computation efficiently
- Typically (1) is most important, but sometimes (2) is also critical, e.g.,programs for collision detection
- Even when (1) is most important, it valuable to understand and optimize (2)
