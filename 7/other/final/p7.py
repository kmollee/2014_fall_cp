"""
A Frob is an object that has a name, and two connections or links: a "before" and an "after" link that are intended to point to other instances of objects.

We can use Frobs to form a data structure called a doubly linked list. In a doubly linked list, each element has the property that if element A has a "before" link to element B, then element B has an "after" link to element A. We want to create a doubly linked collection of Frob instances with the property that all Frobs with names that are alphabetically before a specific Frob's name appear ordered along the "before" link, and all Frobs with names that are alphabetically after a specific Frob's name appear ordered along the "after" link.
