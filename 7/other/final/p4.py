"""
Answer the following question without running the code. The procedure isMyNumber is used to hide a secret number (integer). It takes an integer x as a parameter and compares it to the secret number. It returns:

-1 if the parameter x is less than the secret number

0 if the parameter x is correct

1 if the parameter x is greater than the secret number

The following procedure, jumpAndBackPedal, attempts to guess a secret number. The only way it can interact with the secret number is through the isMyNumber procedure explained above.
